# Data Professional Survey Analysis using PowerBI
In this project, I used the Data Professional Survey data which is publicly available online. The data is cleaned for my requirements. After data cleaning, I made a dashboard to visualize different
aspects and relations among different data from the survey. I used **Power BI** for the data visualization and **Power Query** for the data cleaning process.
